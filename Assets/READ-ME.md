# Peter's Portfolio Page

## Description

- This page was built to be a portfolio for potential employers to view after Bootcamp is over
- A professional portfolio is essential to competing in the coding world
- The portfolio links to information about me, my past projects, and my contact information


## Installation

A  code editor and a web browser are useful for viewing the code and running the HTML and CSS elements. An e-mail client is useful for using the links to e-mail the developer, but is not required. 

## Usage

The site can be browsed using the navigation bar at the top of the page, which links to different portions of the page. 

## Credits

The only collaborator was Bootcamp Tutor Anastasia Warren and CodeAcademy tutorials.
